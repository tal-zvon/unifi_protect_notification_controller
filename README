This is a demo of how to enable/disable notifications from Python on a
Unifi Protect system using httpx (async).

httpx is almost exactly the same syntax as requests, so it should be
trivial to convert this into sync code that uses requests. I only used
async because most python scripts for home assistant use async.

The only real requirements are pydantic, and httpx

To use, just modify the variables at the top of the script.

IMPORTANT NOTE: A user can only control their own notification settings, so
they MUST login as the user whos notification settings you want to change.
